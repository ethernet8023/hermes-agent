"""TLS trust for Hermes. One authority, one trust source.

Trust comes from the platform verifier via ``truststore``: CryptoAPI on
Windows, Security.framework on macOS, and OpenSSL's own store (with a
distro candidate sweep) on Linux. That is the machine's real answer to
"is this chain valid", so a corporate MITM root installed by MDM, an
internal CA, and a locked-down NixOS box all work with no configuration.

``install_truststore()`` runs once at process start and patches
``ssl.SSLContext`` process-wide, so every stack that builds a default
context inherits it — httpx, requests/urllib3, aiohttp, AND the stdlib
``urllib.request`` call sites (the llama.cpp engine download among them)
that a certifi-only or requests-only approach never reached.

The only thing above the platform store is EXPLICIT PER-PROVIDER CONFIG:
``ssl_ca_cert`` (a self-signed or internal endpoint's bundle) and
``ssl_verify: false`` (local development). Those are deliberate
statements about one endpoint, not an ambient guess about the machine.
