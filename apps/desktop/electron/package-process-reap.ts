/**
 * package-process-reap.ts
 *
 * Reap every process still running out of our MSIX package root at shutdown.
 *
 * Why this exists. A Desktop-Bridge (Centennial) MSIX package activates inside
 * a Desktop AppX container: Windows creates a Job Object for the package family
 * and converts it to a silo. One live process rooted in the family pins that
 * silo. While it is pinned, EVERY later activation of the family fails at the
 * conversion step:
 *
 *   AppModel-Runtime/Admin
 *   [215] 0x80070020: Cannot create the Desktop AppX container for package
 *         <full name> because an error was encountered converting the job.
 *   [208] 0x80070020: Cannot create the process for package <full name>
 *         because an error was encountered while configuring runtime.
 *         [LaunchProcess]
 *
 * 0x80070020 is ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION, which Windows surfaces to the user as
 * "The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another
 * process" — a file-lock message for what is really a container-layer failure.
 *
 * Observed live on windows-11-arm: the payload's own bundled-git gpg-agent.exe
 * (under tools/git-<version>/usr/bin/) had daemonized, outlived its package by
 * a week, and pinned the family. Killing that ONE pid turned [215]/[208] into
 * [210] Created / [211] Added on the very next activation, with nothing else
 * changed.
 *
 * Why the platform does not save us. Deployment already asks for the shutdown
 * (ForceApplicationShutdownOption + ForceTargetApplicationShutdownOption) and
 * it still missed the daemon; the old package folder then failed to move with
 * `0x80070005` and Windows logged `[503] The file system entries ... could not
 * be cleaned up after reboot. The package is removed from the purge list.`
 * Once that happens not even a reboot clears it. Our daemon defeated the
 * platform's own mechanism, so the reap is ours to do.
 *
 * Why not a process-TREE kill. `taskkill /T` walks parentage, and a daemon that
 * detaches is by construction no longer in our tree — that is what daemonizing
 * means. Tree scoping is the actual bug. Install-root scoping is what matches
 * the silo: the pin is "a process whose image lives under this package", so
 * that is exactly the predicate to kill on.
 *
 * Why not a gpg-specific kill. `gpgconf --kill all` is scoped by GNUPGHOME, not
 * by install root, so it can reach the user's OWN gpg-agent outside our package
 * — real collateral harm for a case the generic path reap already covers. One
 * mechanism, no per-daemon special cases: any future payload tool that
 * daemonizes is caught with no new code.
 *
 * Scoping. Two roots hold binaries this install owns, and either can hold the
 * straggler:
 *
 *   1. The artifact itself — resources/ on a bundled/MSIX install, which
 *      contains agent-payload (repo + venv + its own tool store).
 *   2. The per-install managed tool store — where pm stages node, git, uv,
 *      ripgrep and friends for a MUTABLE install (an install.ps1 / install.sh
 *      checkout). That is HERMES_RUNTIME_DIR when set, else <hermes root>/tools.
 *      A bundled payload sets HERMES_RUNTIME_DIR at its own store, so the two
 *      roots coincide there and the overlap is harmless.
 *
 * A mutable install has exactly the same daemon problem with none of the MSIX
 * framing: node tooling, a language server, or bundled git's gpg-agent under
 * <hermes root>/tools keeps running and holds an open handle on the very files
 * the next `hermes update` wants to replace. On Windows a running image cannot
 * be overwritten, which is the same 0x80070020 the user reads as "used by
 * another process". Reaping both roots covers both install shapes with one
 * predicate.
 *
 * The roots are deliberately the CURRENT install's, not the package family or
 * every Hermes on the box: once this ships, each shutdown reaps its own
 * processes, so no install leaves a daemon behind. Cleaning up a straggler
 * that a PREVIOUS version already leaked needs a repair path outside the
 * install (the app cannot launch to clean up after itself) and is tracked
 * separately.
 *
 * Live-verified on windows-11-arm at Medium Mandatory Level (admin=False, the
 * integrity level the app actually runs at): all 6 package-rooted processes
 * enumerated, all killed, 0 remaining, 0 with an unreadable path — then the
 * next activation logged [210]/[211] and the app came up clean.
 *
 * Pure module: no electron import, no process globals reached directly, every
 * dependency injected — so the predicate and the ordering are asserted against
 * the real function rather than by grepping main.ts.
