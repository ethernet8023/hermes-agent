/**
 * stage-agent-payloads.mjs: assemble the resources-resident agent runtime

 * .hermes/plans/2026-08-07_resources-resident-bundled-runtime.md.
 *
 * Output: apps/desktop/build/agent-payload/
 *   manifest.json          schemaVersion, tag, commit, platform, arch
 *   repo/                  plain source tree at the release tag (no .git),
 *                          plus the PREBUILT JS surfaces (ui-tui dist +
 *                          node_modules, web_dist) and the build stamp
 *   uv/                    static uv binary for this platform/arch
 *   python/                uv-managed CPython (python-build-standalone).
 *                          Its own site-packages carries hermes-bundle.pth
 *                          with RELATIVE paths to repo/ and site-packages/,
 *                          so the interpreter resolves the runtime wherever
 *                          the app bundle sits — no venv, no PYTHONPATH.
 *   site-packages/         the full dependency tree from uv.lock, installed
 *                          at build time with `pip install --target` on the
 *                          payload interpreter. The backend runs directly
 *                          from here; nothing materializes at first launch.
 *   node/                  official node dist for this platform/arch
 *
 * Gating: the script does nothing unless HERMES_DESKTOP_VARIANT=bundled.
 * That variable is an internal build-time env for CI wiring, not user
 * config. Thus dev builds and current CI keep producing external builds.
 * There is no per-item skip: an embedded payload is complete, or this
 * script throws and the build fails.
 *
 * The heavy work shells out to git, uv, and tar. The decision logic
 * (target resolution, pip arg construction, manifest shape) is exported as
 * pure functions. Thus vitest covers it without network or toolchains.
