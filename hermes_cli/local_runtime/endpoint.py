"""Endpoint resolution for llamacpp-alias requests (provider integration).

The seam between the existing provider mechanism and the managed runtime:
``provider: llamacpp`` with no explicit base_url resolves, in order, to

1. the managed server this Hermes is supervising (state file written by
   LlamaServerSupervisor.start, removed on stop, staleness-checked), or
2. a detected external llama-server.

Returns None when neither exists — the caller falls through to the normal
custom-provider path and its own error reporting.
