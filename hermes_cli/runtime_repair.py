"""Managed Python runtime repair (checkout venv surgery).

The Python backing a CHECKOUT install is shared by every Hermes profile
because the checkout's ``venv`` is shared.  A vulnerable interpreter is
never reinstalled in place: we provision a new immutable Python generation
into the install's runtime dir, build and smoke-test a relocatable sibling
venv, then cut over with same-filesystem renames.  The old venv remains
available for synchronous rollback and is parked for cleanup after the
updating process releases it.

Sealed trees never reach this module — their interpreter is a build
artifact (pm's ``sealed()`` payloads ship a staged python and refuse
runtime installs).

uv itself is NOT this module's business: the pinned uv is realized through
``pm`` (``pm/lock.json`` + the pm store), like every other managed tool.
This module was previously ``hermes_cli.managed_uv`` and carried its own
uv acquisition; that half predated the package manager and is retired.
