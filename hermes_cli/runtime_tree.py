"""Derive who owns the running tree — no stored mode flags.

The install model has two axes (design:
.hermes/plans/2026-08-07_183000-two-axis-install-model.md):

* A tree with ``.git`` is a **git checkout**: ``hermes update`` owns it.
  The checkout's existence IS the fact; no manifest records it.
* A tree without ``.git`` is **sealed**: something external replaces it
  wholesale. The build stamp (``install-stamp.json``) names that
  steward in its ``distribution`` field: ``desktop-app`` (the embedded
  desktop bundle), ``docker``, ``nix``, or a future package manager.

The update channel (``stable`` or ``main``) lives in config.yaml under
``update.channel``. It applies to git checkouts only — sealed trees
version-track through their stewards.

If a future feature writes to user checkouts (nothing does today), it
must add an explicit opt-out fact FIRST. The old ``manageStyle: ejected``
stickiness guarded against desktop-side adoption and rematerialization;
both are deleted, so the guard went with them.

This is a pure-stdlib leaf module. It does not import hermes_cli.config.
