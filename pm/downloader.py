"""Resumable, hash-verified, multi-connection downloads.

Every large fetch in Hermes goes through this one downloader: pm
packages (pinned sha256 from lock.json) and local models (deliberately
unverified — catalog sizes may lag an upstream re-upload, so sha256 is
optional per source).

Partial state is the downloader's own. Files land in a managed
partials area keyed by sha256(url), and a finished file is MOVED into
its real destination, so a caller only ever sees a complete file or
nothing. An interrupted download leaves its partial + a .ranges sidecar
(the durable byte-range bitmap) behind, and the next run re-fetches
exactly the ranges the bitmap says are missing.

The progress callback reports the whole job AND the per-dest bitmap:
``progress(overall_done, overall_total, ranges)`` where ``ranges`` maps
``dest.name`` to half-open [start, end) runs. ``done_bytes`` is the sum;
``ranges`` is the shape — one datum, two resolutions.
